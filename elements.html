									  I would say that I'm creative, hard-working, and detail-oriented.I think that I'm an analytical, dependable,
									  and responsible person.
									  I am a hard-working and driven individual who isn't afraid to face a challenge.I'm passionate about my work 
									  and I know how to get the job done.I would describe myself as an open and honest person who doesn't believe 
									  in misleading other people and tries to be fair in everything I do.
									  I'm very communicative, detail-oriented, and versatile. I like to think of myself as a team player. While I don't
									  mind taking on solo projects, I prefer to work with others.I like to think that I'm persistent and persuasive.
									  Well, I'm very knowledgeable in my fields. I have experience in IT for over 5years,Thanks to my years of experience,
									  I'm very meticulous in my work. I also like to keep things very professional. I'm very direct in all of my communications,

									 My most valuable trait is that I'm a people person who enjoys meeting new individuals and learning about their lives.
									 I always find some common ground with everyone even if I have to get creative to do so.It's always helpful when you have someone
									 on your team that you can rely on to make your customers feel comfortable and at ease and is emotionally resourceful in repairing 
									 or improving relationships within the team. I pride myself on having those traits.
									 I'm a mature, candid individual who has values and integrity. My confidence in myself and those traits are the reason people tend
									 to come to me for answers to questions even if I'm not in a leadership position. Even if I don't know the answer, I know I can point
									 someone in the right direction.
									 I'm a positive and resourceful individual who can execute difficult tasks and doesn't need to be micromanaged.
                                     I'm a resolute and dependable person with unwavering determination to do well at my job and solve problems in the most autonomous
									 manner possible.
